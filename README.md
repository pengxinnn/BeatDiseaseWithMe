They could also apply the filter to the posts. 
Filters here including the tags, locations and user types. 
What's more, users could also choose to sort these posts by likes or time.
Also, there are suggested posts for regular users, by default, we will show the newest posts. But if user filter to show only following, we will show the newest posts of their following users.
When they find the post they want, they could click the post title to see the whole post.

## For professional users:
The pages of professional user are similar to regular user, but there're also several difference between them.

### Search Page

### Post Page

 followed by others.
 
### New Post Page

## For admin:
### Manage Posts Page
- Admin can search the posts by post titles in the search bar. They can see the entire post after they click the "DETAILS" button so they could choose to delete the posts by clicking the trash icon.

### Manage Users Page

### Authorize Accounts Page

## Difference with proposal
1) In the proposal, we decided to add a star level for each professional account.
However, we found out later that this idea would lead to the consequence that users
may only willing to read the post from authors with high star levels. So we remove 
this feature currently.

2) To make our websites be more beneficial for users to find their target information, we decided to
add tags and locations feature for each post. This could raise the search efficiency and help users 
find the target information more quickly. Tags show whether the post is a donation info, lockdown policy updates or just public health. 
For the search page, users can now select a tag and a location. For example, when a user selects a tag as “Donation information” and location as “Canada”, posts about donation information in Canada will be shown.
